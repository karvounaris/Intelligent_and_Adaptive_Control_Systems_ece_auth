# 🤖 Intelligent and Adaptive Control Systems Project

## 📖 Overview
This project, part of the Intelligent and Adaptive Control Systems course at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, focuses on designing adaptive controllers to manage systems with unknown parameters. Using **Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)** techniques, the project explores both linear and nonlinear control methods. MATLAB simulations are employed to validate the controllers' effectiveness under varying conditions and disturbances.
